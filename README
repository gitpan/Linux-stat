NAME
    Linux::stat - parse /proc/stat

SYNOPSIS
      use Linux::stat;

      my $stat = Linux::stat->new( [ stat => "path to /proc/stat" ] );
      my $hashref = $stat->stat();

    or

      my $hashref = Linux::stat::stat( [ "path to /proc/stat" ] );

DESCRIPTION
    Linux::stat is a simple Perl module which parses /proc/stat
    file. Info is arranged in hash reference with descriptive keys.

    Linux::stat was written on RedHat Linux 7.2, kernel 2.4.7 and
    tested on RedHat 6.2, kernel 2.2.14. It is expected to work with
    other versions as well, but this depends on Linux configuration
    and kernel version.

    Output data can be easily previewed with Data::VarPrint package,
    available at CPAN.

    Output fields (some of these are unavailable on kernels older
    than 2.4):

    boot_timestamp
        Timestamp (number of seconds since epoch) when the system
        was booted

    context_switch
        Context switch, used by Linux job scheduler; for more info
        check Linux kernel sources: kernel/sched.c (look for
        kstat.context_swtch)

    cpu, cpu0, cpu1,...
        Overall and per-CPU time: user, nice, system, idle

    disks
        Disks I/O (for each partition):

    disk - disk number (0 for /dev/hda, 1 for /dev/hdb,...)
    io - total number of I/O requests
    major - major disk number (partition number on the disk)
    read_count - number of reads from disk
    read_sectors - number of sectors read from disk
    write_count - number of writes to disk
    write_sectors - number of sectors written to disk
    disks_io
        Overall disk I/O info; same fields as in disks (of course,
        except for disk and major)

    interrupts
        Number for interrupts for each IRQ

    interrupts_total
        Total number of interrupts (same as sum of all numbers in
        interrupts)

    kstat.*
        Not parsed, just added to hash

    pages_in
        Number of pages read

    pages_out
        Number of pages written

    swap_pages_in
        Number of pages read from swap

    swap_pages_out
        Number of pages written to swap

    total_forks
        Number of processes run since boot

    uptime
        System uptime in seconds (same as sum of all four times for
        cpu)

    All not-recognized fields are just passed on without parsing.

OPTIONS
    Currently, the only option available is stat which is path to
    /proc/stat in case this changes for some reason.

FILES
    /proc/stat CPU, disk and some other information

REQUIRES
    Perl 5.000
